COMPILING
*********

Compile the program with a command like

	$ gcc -o randip randip6.c

USE
***

randip reads when executed 4 * 2 bytes from /dev/urandom and converts them into hexadecimal numbers.
This numbers are displayed in a form you may directly append to a /64 prefix, e.g.

$ ./randip
:ddde:330a:ff9a:7d43

You may use it in a bootup script like this:

(Linux, iproute2)

	SUFFIX=`/usr/local/bin/randip`
	ip addr add 1234:4321:5678:8765${SUFFIX}/64 dev eth0

So you may configure your system without the need of SLAAC (Stateless Address Autoconfiguration, as described in RFC 2462) 
and Privacy Extensions (RFC 4941). This is nice when using a 6over4 tunnel which does not provide SLAAC but you want to use 
changing addresses.

ATTENTION: This solution is not as elegant and secure as SLAAC, so use it only when you're sure what you're doing!!!
